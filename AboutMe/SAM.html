           <hr><h3>Something About Me</h3>
                <p>I am 15 and a rising sophmore at Maynard Jackson Highschool that likes playing video games, watching youtube, and bindging netflix. I am not completely sure of what college I want to seek, but I know that I want to follow a career path related to STEM. Throughout my life I've been picked out in class by peers for being a knowledgeable scholar, although I believe that I still have much more to learn. While I do enjoy doing things that teenagers my age also like doing, I do want expand my field of knowledge beyond my traditional classroom, so that is why I decided to join the SMASH program. <a href="Homepg.html">Back</a></p>
