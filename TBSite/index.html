            <h3>Our Project</h3>
            <p id="mainp">How might we inform our community of the increased risk of getting Tuberculosis (TB) due to the misuse of antibiotics which can create antibiotic resistance? A solution to decreasing the risk of getting antibiotic resistance, making it easier to treat TB, is to inform people in susceptible communities about this illness and antibiotic resistance. We can inform these people by handing out our syringe model, a model syringe that can be opened, and when opened a piece of paper inside will inform citizens about TB and antibiotic resistance. ¼ to ⅓ of the world’s population are infected with TB. This data shows the severity and contagiousness of the illness. With the syringe we can help people by decreasing the population of susceptible individuals in a population through education.</p>
