            <p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/factsheets/statistics/tbtrends.htm">The CDC</a> states that: “In 2016, a total of 68.5% of reported TB cases in the United States occurred among non-U.S.–born persons. The case rate among non-U.S.–born persons (14.7 cases per 100,000 persons) was approximately 14 times higher than among U.S.-born persons (1.1 cases per 100,000 persons).”  Also states that in the U.S. the transmission rate was only 2.9 per 100,000 people and can be infectious in all states. Data to the right represents the amount of TB deaths in the world over the past 20 years. Other data also states that after three months of drug treatment for pulmonary TB caused by drug susceptible bacteria, 90-95% of patients will have negative sputum or culture and show clinical improvement. <a href="index.html">Back</a></p>
